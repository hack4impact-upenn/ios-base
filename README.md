### Setting Up 


##### Update Xcode

Make sure you are updated to Xcode 8 or above, which comes with Swift 3.0 or above. If you do not have this updated version of Xcode, you can install it on the App Store. If you are not running osX Sierra, you may have to upgrade your operating system before the App Store will allow you to upgrade Xcode. 

##### Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hack4impact/ios-base.git
$ cd ios-base
```

### Set up Parse on Heroku 

Install the Heroku Command Line Interface: 
```
$  brew install heroku
```

Set up the Parse server using this tutorial https://medium.com/@timothy_whiting/setting-up-your-own-parse-server-568ee921333a. This should be done once at the beginning of the project by the PM or TL. Once this is done, do not commit the parse-server-example code to your repository. Also, you may use the Hack4Impact Heroku account for the Heroku deployment. 



##### Install CocoaPods
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
